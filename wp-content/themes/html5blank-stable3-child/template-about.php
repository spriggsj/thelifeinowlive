					<p>After going through my parent's divorce, a broken engagement, the death of 4 friends, two significant job changes, gaining 30 pounds, and numerous lost friendships and a church family, I found myself broken, weary, and questioning God's faithfulness, goodness, and willingness to work in my life
					</p>
					<br>
					<p> 
					There came a point when I stopped running.  Not out of surrender, but out of exhaustion.  I was weary from pursuing perfection and others' approval, and I reached a place where I simply could not handle it anymore.  I realized I was at a crossroads - I could continue doing what I had always done: simply take a deep breath, put on a smile, and carry on; or, I could finally hit the pause button, become vulnerable with myself and those around me, and walk forward into the unknown.  My doubt that God would actually move in my life (even though his power had been clear since I was young) was so strong, so I clung to Jesus' words, "all you need is faith the size of a mustard seed;" that size faith was all I could give.
					</p>
					<br>		 										
					<p> 
					I began taking one tiny step forward at a time.  And as I became more vulnerable and authentic with those around me, my life began to shift.  I discovered a passion for empowering others to ask the tough questions, and reclaim their self, sanity, and sparkle (body, mind, and spirit) to live a new life of freedom.  I began building authentic relationships with those around me, and their love and support began restoring my weary and broken heart.  Then I saw God move in ways only he can, and I was reminded at my core that no experiences we go through are wasted, and more importantly, everyone has a story to share.  We all have the power to speak light into dark situations, but we must first be brave to discover this light in our own lives.  The Life I Now Live is about discovering our limiting beliefs and overcoming them - physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  You have a gift this world needs.  It's time to reclaim it and share it with the world.

						 I received my bachelor's degree in Psychology and master's degree in Sport Psychology from Fresno State, where I studied emotional and environmental factors of behavior change, obesity, and overcoming barriers to exercise.  The Life I Now Live combines my research and Christian faith to offer a comprehensive guide to discovering emotional and spiritual freedom through reclaiming your physical health.  In my spare time, I enjoy riding my motorcycle, connecting with God in his beautiful creation, catching up with friends over coffee or a great meal, painting with my mom, and going for walks with my dog, Lola.
