				<div class="aboutContent">
					<p>After going through my parent's divorce, a broken engagement, the death of 4 friends, two significant job changes, gaining 30 pounds, and numerous lost friendships and a church family, I found myself broken, weary, and questioning God's faithfulness, goodness, and willingness to work in my life
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
					There came a point when I stopped running.  Not out of surrender, but out of exhaustion.  I was weary from pursuing perfection and others' approval, and I reached a place where I simply could not handle it anymore.  I realized I was at a crossroads - I could continue doing what I had always done: simply take a deep breath, put on a smile, and carry on; or, I could finally hit the pause button, become vulnerable with myself and those around me, and walk forward into the unknown.  My doubt that God would actually move in my life (even though his power had been clear since I was young) was so strong, so I clung to Jesus' words, "all you need is faith the size of a mustard seed;" that size faith was all I could give.

					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
					I began taking one tiny step forward at a time.  And as I became more vulnerable and authentic with those around me, my life began to shift.  I discovered a passion for empowering others to ask the tough questions, and reclaim their self, sanity, and sparkle (body, mind, and spirit) to live a new life of freedom.  I began building authentic relationships with those around me, and their love and support began restoring my weary and broken heart.  Then I saw God move in ways only he can, and I was reminded at my core that no experiences we go through are wasted, and more importantly, everyone has a story to share.  We all have the power to speak light into dark situations, but we must first be brave to discover this light in our own lives.  The Life I Now Live is about discovering our limiting beliefs and overcoming them - physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  You have a gift this world needs.  It's time to reclaim it and share it with the world.

              I received my bachelor's degree in Psychology and master's degree in Sport Psychology from Fresno State, where I studied emotional and environmental factors of behavior change, obesity, and overcoming barriers to exercise.  The Life I Now Live combines my research and Christian faith to offer a comprehensive guide to discovering emotional and spiritual freedom through reclaiming your physical health.  In my spare time, I enjoy riding my motorcycle, connecting with God in his beautiful creation, catching up with friends over coffee or a great meal, painting with my mom, and going for walks with my dog, Lola.

                     Katie's program was very beneficial to my physical health! Not long after, I took an overseas trip which involved extensive walking and I felt so prepared! I was enriched by the mental and spiritual portion of the study. Katie has a depth of insight and wisdom that is refreshing and meaningful. I was very blessed and encouraged during a difficult time of grief. I feel so positive about Katie's study that I suggested our group repeat it and we are!<br>

            I am so thankful for the group I was a part of!  I was going through post-partum after my third child and it was such a hard time for me mentally, I really didn’t have an outlet.  Then I heard about this study and I immediately said yes.  For me, it was an answer to prayer because I thought how awesome it would be for there to be a group where there was both a workout and a Bible study – working out our bodies and our souls.  After joining the class, it was way more than I expected.  I got accountability and an outlet; I felt cared for and my body started to feel normal again.  It gave me the push I needed!  I am going through the study again because as a mom of 3, I need it again!  Katie does such a good job making it all worship!  Every week, I can’t wait for the next class.  I saw a transformation in my body and my soul.  I look forward to what God will do in me through this class again.<br>

                  I took Katie Williamson's class "The Life I now Live," last spring.  I was a little hesitant because I am 73 years old and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to keep up.  No need to fear.  The exercises were not difficult and easy to modify.  The most powerful part of the study was the discussion that went along with the curriculum.  Many basic biblical and psychological principles were interwoven into the lessons.   These principles were used to help us develop a working discipline for both the physical and spiritual areas of our lives.  Attention was given to discovering what things and attitudes blocked our progress.  I was challenged by the study and I'm planning on repeating it this fall.  I would give this study a five-star rating!<br>

                I really enjoyed this bible study with Katie. I thought it was encouraging, and was so motivated each week to pursue health in different ways, whether it was in my eating, exercise, spiritual life, or interpersonal relationships. I learned that I am capable of much more than I previously thought, and would love to continue growing! It was challenging, fun, and encouraging.<br>
